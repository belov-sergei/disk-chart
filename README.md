## Goals
I've always been a fan of the [Scanner utility by Steffen Gerlach](http://steffengerlach.de/freeware/index.html), but unfortunately, as the size of my disk grew, it became slower and slower, and it seems the Scanner project has ceased development.

I thought it would be beneficial and interesting to write an analog of this utility myself, as I've never developed such a project before. Thus, I began working on Scan My Disk. The main goals I aim to achieve in this project are:

### High Performance:
High-performance scanning and display for quick and effective processing of large and complex file systems.

### User-Friendly and Accessible:
An intuitive and accessible application with a user-friendly interface, supporting multiple languages and platforms, including mobile platforms.

### Enhanced File Operations:
The ability to perform direct file operations from the application, such as deleting, moving, or archiving files.

## How to Use
You can download the pre-built versions of the application from the Releases section for your Windows or macOS. Alternatively, you can build the application yourself. All necessary libraries and dependencies are already in the repository, so you'll just need to clone it.

## Building
To build the application, you will need the latest versions Xcode for macOS or Visual Studio 2022 for Windows, with support for C++20.

### Clone the Repository
```
git clone git@github.com:belov-sergei/scan-my-disk.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Root
```
cd scan-my-disk
```

### Create a Build Directory
```
mkdir Build
cd Build
```

### Run CMake
```
cmake .. -G "Your Generator"
```

### Build the Project
Once the build configuration is generated, the simplest way to compile the application is to open the generated solution file in your IDE and run the build project.

## Upcoming Plans

In the near future, I am focusing on several improvements and new features to enhance Scan My Disk:

### Code Refactoring:
- Organize and clean up the current codebase. Much of the code was initially written quickly to test core functionalities. I plan to revisit and refine the architecture and code quality.

### Interface Enhancement:
- Improve the program's interface to make it more attractive. I aim to add color schemes and overall design improvements for a better user experience.

### Operating System Integration:
- Enhance integration with different operating systems to ensure smoother performance and better user interaction across various platforms.

### Navigation Features:
- Implement new navigation features for disk and diagram exploration, making it easier to understand and manage file distribution and disk space.

### Memory Optimization:
- Optimize memory usage to ensure the application runs efficiently, especially when handling large files and complex directory structures.

### Performance Boost:
- Continue to improve the scanning and processing speed to handle growing disk sizes and complex file systems, ensuring a high-performance experience for all users.
